# StreetVendorConnect

A full-stack web platform connecting street food businesses to customers, built with Next.js and Firebase Genkit.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And in a separate terminal, run the Genkit development server for AI features:

```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start exploring the application from `src/app/page.tsx`. The pages auto-update as you edit the files.
